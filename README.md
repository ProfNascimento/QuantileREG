# QuantileREG

This repository relates to the research that quantifies the efficiency of a transportation start-up (UberX) in Fortaleza towards discussing socioeconomic inequality and logistic transportation costs in the north of Brazil (as a study case). Nine thousand travel records were obtained during two weeks, between August-September of 2021.

After clustering the city in three areas (poor-middle-rich zone), the router poor-rich transport travel pricing registers were higher than 75% when compared to other data records. In a more decentralized scenario of a financial center, low-income users could have their commuting prices reduced by about 43.07%. This reduction would represent a monthly saving of around 18.82% of their Average Personal Income, with an impact of 6.71% of gain on their Average Personal Income. Regardless of the origin or destination, the flux from or to the poor- and rich-class is evidently noticeable, classes (\#3) POOR -> RICH \& (\#7) RICH -> POOR. The 3rd Quantile (75\%) price is R\$ 20.7, represented by the dashed red line, which shows that classes \#3 \& \#7 are always above other direction types.
